## Project Overview

YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can recognize multiple objects within an image or video frame. This project is a basic implementation and test of the YOLO model, showcasing its capabilities in object detection.

The repository includes scripts for loading pre-trained YOLO models, running the model on sample images and videos, and visualizing the results.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed and set up the required dependencies. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies

The main dependencies include:
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- PyTorch (if using the YOLO model through a PyTorch implementation)
- Other libraries as needed (e.g., `requests` for downloading model weights)

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nerry-AXL/YOLO_test.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd YOLO_test
    ```

3. **Download YOLO weights:**
   Download the pre-trained YOLO weights if not included in the repository. You can use the following command:

    ```bash
    python download_weights.py
    ```

4. **Run YOLO on images:**
   To test YOLO on sample images:

    ```bash
    python detect.py --source path_to_your_image.jpg
    ```

5. **Run YOLO on videos:**
   To test YOLO on sample videos:

    ```bash
    python detect.py --source path_to_your_video.mp4
    ```

6. **Visualize results:**
   The detection results will be saved in an output directory and can be visualized using image viewing software or directly within the notebook.

## YOLO Model

The YOLO model works by dividing an image into grids and predicting bounding boxes and probabilities for each grid cell. The algorithm prioritizes speed and is known for its efficiency in real-time object detection.

This project supports various versions of YOLO (e.g., YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5), depending on your preference and the specific implementation used.

## Evaluation

The model's performance can be evaluated using common object detection metrics like:

- **Precision and Recall:** To measure the model's ability to correctly detect objects.
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP):** To summarize the precision-recall curve and evaluate the model's accuracy.
- **Frames per Second (FPS):** To measure the model's speed in processing images/videos in real-time.

## Results

The project demonstrates YOLO's effectiveness in detecting multiple objects in different scenarios. Results are displayed with bounding boxes around detected objects, along with class labels and confidence scores.
